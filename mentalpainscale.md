# Mental and Emotional Self-Awareness Pain Scale

## 1
### Awareness
When I stop and breathe and sense, I feel some sadness or anxiety. 
### Insight
I can name the feelings. I can tie them to some unmet-need sense I'm experiencing. 
### Coping
I feel fine; nothing to "cope with". 
### Functioning
I can do what I like.
### Openness
I can see options open to me.

## 2 
### Awareness
I'm aware of some sadness or anxiety.
### Insight
I can name the feelings. I can tie them to some unmet-need sense I'm experiencing.
### Coping
I can spend time noticing the need, appreciating the beauty it represents.
### Functioning
I can do what I like. I'm not easily annoyed.
### Openness
I'm able to find options I like. I don't feel constricted.

## 3 
### Awareness
I'm aware of sadness or anxiety, and it's uncomfortable.
### Insight
If I choose to pay attention, I can name the feelings. It's a little work to begin to get insight into the unmet-need sense. It's harder to find the underlying longing, or to imagine what it would be like to have the treasure I'm longing for. 
### Coping
Almost any distraction easily makes the discomfort fade. If I think it'd be valuable, I can set the sadness or anxiety aside to look at later.
### Functioning
It takes a little work to do professional activities: attending meetings, conversing, empathizing, problem solving, coding. It might take work not to be grumpy with family.
### Openness
I'm choosing distraction -- gettin shit done. I'm generally open to doing the work to move toward level 2, if it occurs to me or someone asks.  

## 4
### Awareness
I'm feeling distinctly sad or anxious. "Not okay."
### Insight
Paying attention to my experience is work. If I remember to, I might use a noticing exercise to get more insight.
### Coping
I'm breathing, practicing self-empathy. Still turning my attention to profession & daily life, but distraction is less effective. Sometimes, I can set the sadness or anxiety aside to look at later.  
### Functioning
It's harder to do professional activities: attending meetings, conversing, empathizing, problem solving, coding. I may take breaks, try to avoid meetings. Or I may sit through them, hoping the distraction will help relieve discomfort.  Similarly, with personal life, I may try to avoid getting together or I might hope the distraction makes it easier. 
### Openness
I'm likely not looking for options; telling myself I don't have choices. If I remember, I might choose to do the work to move toward level 3 or level 2. (If there's a professional task ahead that's challenging and important, there's a good chance I can succeed at taking a half hour to work toward level 3 or 2 so I can do an okay job. I won't be at my best.)

## 5
### Awareness
I'm feeling quite sad or anxious. I can feel it in my body. It's distracting, and probably clearly visible on my face & movements.
### Insight
I'm reactive. I don't have much awareness of my internal state, but I react strongly to minor disruptions. 
### Coping
Self-care here looks like "taking it easy" -- drawing, video games, reading, a warm bath. Distracting myself doesn't make sadness or anxiety fade out entirely. *Coping depends a lot on avoiding stress.* 
### Functioning
Things can seem normal. The differences is that I have an intolerance for tiny stresses (pen doesn't work, code does something unexpected, github acts weird, we're out of cheese, I dunno...) Strong feelings: tears, shaking, covering my ears. If work is solitary, I continue trying to accomplish things. If work means real engagement with people, at this point I leave quickly.
### Openness
Self-care here feels like staying in the moment. Creating an environment as close to no stress as possible. Sometimes I might try what we jokingly call an "emergency sit", which could move me to a 4 or 3, but my priority isn't on fixing. It's on wrapping up in a blanket and accepting me where I'm at right now. And lots of care from loved ones.

## 6
### Awareness
Sadness or anxiety has my attention. 
### Insight
Identifying or naming feelings in any subtle way is difficult. They feel unconnected with life. Wanting safety & comfort. 
### Coping
Delicate conversation on topics unrelated to my emotional state, only with people who feel safe and comfortable. Video games, movies, light reading.
### Functioning
Nothing but self-care. 
### Openness
Recognizing my feelings and the underlying needs/treasures is real work. I don't like any of the options I can see. I feel stuck. Questioning: remind me again why I'm supposed to stay alive?

## 7
### Awareness
Just aware of hurting.
### Insight
Reaching for awareness of my experience isn't working very well.
### Coping
Warm bath, walk. Staying close to people who are focused on caring for me.
### Functioning
Not much attention to even self-care. Not getting food. Not looking for comfort.
### Openness
Trying to remember that there are always options, but I don't really believe it. Wishing I could go to sleep and not wake up, but not actively suicidal.

## 8
### Awareness
Just hurting. 
### Insight
Not aware, not reaching for awareness. Not responding well. 
### Coping
Can't enjoy movies or reading or real games. Might play mindless phone games some.
### Functioning
Mostly just breathe, cry some, breathe.
### Openness
I don't see options. Probably thinking more seriously of suicide.

## 9
### Awareness
Just hurting.
### Insight
No awareness of needs or treasures.
### Coping
Basically lying in bed, or rocking back and forth. Roughly.
### Functioning
Breathe, cry, breathe.
### Openness
I've forgotten the idea of possibility, of options. Avoiding suicide is work.

## 10

### Insight
No awareness of needs or treasures.
### Coping
No intentional coping.

Zombie.

Can't find a way forward. Contemplating or planning suicide.

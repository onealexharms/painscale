# Mental and Emotional Self-Awareness Pain Scale

1. When I stop and breathe and sense, I feel some sadness or anxiety. I'm able to attend to it, and tie it to what sorts of unmet-need sense I'm experiencing. I can see options open to me.

2. I'm aware of some sadness or anxiety, and I'm aware of the unmet-need sense. I'm able to work through it to see what needs-met would feel like. I can find options open to me, though it takes effort.

3. Sadness or anxiety are troubling, but distraction easily makes the pain fade. When I do attend to it, it's hard to find the underlying longing (need, or treasure) that has my attention, or to recognize what needs-met would feel like. Options are hard to notice.

4. I have to work to distract myself from sadness or anxiety. Working through them is difficult. Options seem few.

5. Distracting myself doesn't make sadness or anxiety fade out entirely.  Can work (focus, empathize, problem solve), but with greatly reduced capacity. Extended time for working through the emotions might help, but options are not apparent.

6. Can't focus on work. Sadness or anxiety has my attention. Can do delicate conversation on topics unrelated to my emotional state, only with people who feel safe & comfortable. Recognizing my feelings and the underlying needs/treasures is real work. At this point, I don't like any of the options available to me.

7. Can do self-care activities, and not much else. Warm bath, walk. Can only be around people who are with me are focused on caring for me. I am trying to remember that I have options, but I don't really believe it. Reaching for awareness of my experience isn't working very well.

8. Can't manage even light conversation, not responding well. Can't enjoy reading, movies, or games. Can do simple games for a while. Mostly just breathe or cry. Probably thinking some about suicide. I don't see options.

9. Basically just in bed, rocking back and forth. Or something roughly like that. Probably feeling like avoiding suicide is work. I've forgotten the idea of options.

10. Can't find a way forward. Contemplating or planning suicide.

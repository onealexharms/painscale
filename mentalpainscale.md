## 1
### Awareness
When I stop and breathe and sense, I feel some sadness or anxiety. 
### Insight
I can name the feelings. I can tie them to some unmet-need sense I'm experiencing. 
### Coping
I don't feel a need for coping strategies.
### Functioning
Work, family, and personal activities are not affected.
### Openness
I can see options open to me.

## 2 
### Awareness
I'm aware of some sadness or anxiety.
### Insight
I can name the feelings. I can tie them to some unmet-need sense I'm experiencing.
### Coping
Living with my emotions feels natural and easy.
### Functioning
I can do what I like. I'm resilient, not easily stressed, accepting of change.
### Openness
I'm able to find options I like. I don't feel constricted.

## 3 
### Awareness
I'm aware of sadness or anxiety, and it's uncomfortable.
### Insight
If I slow down and pay attention, I have ready access to what's happening inside me.
### Coping
I'm in alignment (the same on the inside as on the outside). I'm being authentic, and not needing to reach for coping strategies.
### Functioning
I'm able to choose to put my attention to professional activities: attending meetings, conversing, empathizing, problem solving, coding. The sadness or anxiety can wait, and I can revisit it, and discover what needs are coming up later. I may find myself "faking it", less able to be in alignment (the same on the inside as I am  on the outside.)
### Openness
I might forget that I have options, or that I can do the work to move toward level 2. If I think of it, I can sit and breathe and get in touch with what's happening inside me.

## 4
### Awareness
I'm feeling distinctly sad or anxious. "Not okay."
### Insight
If I choose to pay attention, I can name the feelings. It's a little work to begin to get insight into the unmet-need sense. It's harder to find the underlying longing, or to imagine what it would be like to have the treasure I'm longing for. If I remember to, I might use a noticing exercise to get more insight.
### Coping
I am beginning to use coping strategies. 
Do I choose things that I worry damage me? (Using intoxication, sex, food, shopping, etc, in harmful ways?) Do I have ways to give myself comfort that are more nurturing than harmful? Do I reach for support from friends?
I may take a break to breathe, practice self-empathy. Still turning my attention to profession & daily life. Sometimes, I can set the sadness or anxiety aside to look at later.  
### Functioning
It's harder to do professional activities: attending meetings, conversing, empathizing, problem solving, coding. I may take breaks, try to avoid meetings. Or I may sit through them, hoping the distraction will help relieve discomfort.  Similarly, with personal life, I may try to avoid getting together or I might hope the distraction makes it easier. 
It might take work not to be grumpy with family. I may find myself "faking it", less able to be in alignment (the same on the inside as I am  on the outside.)
### Openness
I may have forgotten about options, started telling myself I don't have choices. If I remember, I might choose to _do the work_ to move toward level 3 or level 2. 

## 5
### Awareness
I'm feeling quite sad or anxious. I can feel it in my body. It's distracting, and probably clearly visible on my face & movements.
### Insight
I'm reactive. I don't have much awareness of my internal state, but I react strongly to minor disruptions. I may be irritable or anxious for reasons I see as trivial.
### Coping
Non-harmful coping choices seem more limited. I reach for what's easiest. *Coping depends a lot on avoiding stress.* 
### Functioning
Sometimes I feel "normal", then suddenly react to tiny stressors ("spilled milk"). Strong feelings come up: tears, shaking, covering my ears. If work is solitary, I may continue trying to accomplish things. If work means real engagement with people, it's much harder to continue. I may call in sick.
### Openness
If I'm able to remember the importance of self-care, I'll prioritize staying in the moment, reducing stress (change, challenges, surprises) as much as possible. Sometimes I might try what we jokingly call an "emergency sit", which could move me to a 4 or 3, but my priority isn't on fixing. It's on wrapping up in a blanket and accepting me where I'm at right now. And lots of care from loved ones.

## 6
### Awareness
Sadness or anxiety has my nearly all my attention. 
### Insight
Identifying or naming feelings in any subtle way is difficult. Wanting safety & comfort. 
### Coping
At this point, continuing to aim for non-harmful coping strategies, I'm taking care by doing things that feel nice. I might enjoy gentle conversation on topics unrelated to my emotional state, but only with people who feel safe and comfortable. Video games, movies, light reading.
### Functioning
If I'm at work, I'm not getting much done. I'm likely to be at work because of fears around losing income and health insurance. 
### Openness
Recognizing my feelings and the underlying needs/treasures is real work. I don't like any of the options I can see. I feel stuck. Questioning: remind me again why I'm supposed to stay alive?

## 7
### Awareness
Sadness or anxiety takes all my attention. I feel alone. I can't see the people who care about me.
### Insight
Self-empathy is out of reach. Maybe I'm so alone, I can't see _myself_.
### Coping
If I can, I'll remember kindness to myself. I'll work on connection with people who are focused on caring for me.
### Functioning
Not able to work. Hard to remember to care for myself. Not getting food. Not looking for comfort.
### Openness
Trying to remember that there are always options, but I don't really believe it. 

## 8
### Awareness
Just hurting. Thoughts of worthlessness. (Maybe not new, but louder.) 
### Insight
I may be upset about "everything" or I may have no awareness of needs or treasures. 
### Coping
Can't enjoy movies or reading or real games. Might play mindless phone games some.
### Functioning
Mostly just breathe, cry some, breathe.
### Openness
I don't see options. I might find myself wishing I could go to sleep and not wake up, without being actively suicidal.

## 9
### Awareness
Just hurting.
### Insight
Not aware, not reaching for awareness. I've forgotten how to interrupt thoughts of my worthlessness. Might be believing them.
### Coping
Basically lying in bed, or rocking back and forth. Coping is being done by other people (checking on me, asking me about suicide, bringing food, asking how they can help).
### Functioning
Breathe, cry, breathe.
### Openness
I've forgotten the idea of possibility, of options. I may have begun wondering how I might actually make a plan for suicide.

## 10
### Awareness
Just hurting.
### Insight
No awareness of needs or treasures.
### Coping
No intentional coping.
### Functioning
Zombie.
### Openness
Can't find a way forward. I may be taking actions toward suicide.

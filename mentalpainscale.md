# Rate your mental/emotional pain on a scale of 1 to 10

1. When I stop and breathe and sense, I feel some sadness or anxiety.

2. I'm aware of some sadness or anxiety, but I feel comfortable with it.

3. Sadness or anxiety are troubling, but distraction easily makes the pain fade.

4. I have to work to distract myself from sadness or anxiety.

5. Distracting myself doesn't make sadness or anxiety fade out entirely.  Can work (focus, empathize, problem solve), but with greatly reduced capacity.

6. Can't focus on work. Sadness or anxiety has my attention. Can do delicate conversation, only with people who feel safe & comfortable. Nothing emotionally challenging.

7. Can do self-care activities, and not much else. Warm bath, walk. Can only be around people who are with me are focused on caring for me.

8. Can't manage even light conversation, not responding well. Can't enjoy reading, movies, or games. Can do simple games for a while. Mostly just breathe or cry. Probably thinking some about suicide.

9. Basically just in bed, rocking back and forth. Or something roughly like that. Probably feeling like avoiding suicide is work.

10. Can't find a way forward. Contemplating or planning suicide.

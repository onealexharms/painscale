# Mental and Emotional Self-Awareness Pain Scale

## 1
### Awareness
When I stop and breathe and sense, I feel some sadness or anxiety. 
### Insight
I can name the feelings. I can tie them to some unmet-need sense I'm experiencing. 
### Coping
I feel fine; nothing to "cope with". 
### Functioning
I can do what I like.
### Openness
I can see options open to me.

## 2 
### Awareness
I'm aware of some sadness or anxiety.
### Insight
I can name the feelings. I can tie them to some unmet-need sense I'm experiencing.
### Coping
I can spend time noticing the need, appreciating the beauty it represents.
### Functioning
I can do what I like. I'm not easily annoyed.
### Openness
I'm able to find options I like. I don't feel constricted.

## 3 
### Awareness
I'm aware of sadness or anxiety, and it's uncomfortable.
### Insight
If I choose to pay attention, I can name the feelings. It's a little work to begin to get insight into the unmet-need sense. It's harder to find the underlying longing, or to imagine what it would be like to have the treasure I'm longing for. 
### Coping
Almost any distraction easily makes the discomfort fade. If I think it'd be valuable, I can set the sadness or anxiety aside to look at later.
### Functioning
It takes a little work to do professional activities: attending meetings, conversing, empathizing, problem solving, coding. It might take work not to be grumpy with family.
### Openness
I'm choosing distraction -- gettin shit done. I'm generally open to doing the work to move toward level 2, if it occurs to me or someone asks.  

## 4
### Awareness
I'm feeling distinctly sad or anxious. "Not okay."
### Insight
Paying attention to my experience is work. If I remember to, I might use a noticing exercise to get more insight.
### Coping
Distraction is less effective. Sometimes, I can set the sadness or anxiety aside to look at later.  
### Functioning
It's harder to do professional activities: attending meetings, conversing, empathizing, problem solving, coding. I may take breaks, try to avoid meetings. Or I may sit through them, hoping the distraction will help relieve discomfort. Similarly, with personal life, I may try to avoid getting together or I might hope the distraction makes it easier. 
### Openness
I'm likely not looking for options; telling myself I don't have choices. If I remember it's an option, I might choose to do the work to move toward level 3 or level 2. This takes time away from planned activities.

'5. Distracting myself doesn't make sadness or anxiety fade out entirely.  Can work (focus, empathize, problem solve), but with greatly reduced capacity. Extended time for working through the emotions might help, but options are not apparent.

'6. Can't focus on work. Sadness or anxiety has my attention. Can do delicate conversation on topics unrelated to my emotional state, only with people who feel safe & comfortable. Recognizing my feelings and the underlying needs/treasures is real work. At this point, I don't like any of the options available to me.

'7. Can do self-care activities, and not much else. Warm bath, walk. Can only be around people who are with me are focused on caring for me. I am trying to remember that I have options, but I don't really believe it. Reaching for awareness of my experience isn't working very well.

'8. Can't manage even light conversation, not responding well. Can't enjoy reading, movies, or games. Can do simple games for a while. Mostly just breathe or cry. Probably thinking some about suicide. I don't see options.

'9. Basically just in bed, rocking back and forth. Or something roughly like that. Probably feeling like avoiding suicide is work. I've forgotten the idea of options.

'10. Can't find a way forward. Contemplating or planning suicide.

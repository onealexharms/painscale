# Physical Self-Awareness Pain Scale 

1. If I think about it, I can find a twinge somewhere.

2. Yeah, there's an ache or whatever, but it's not bothering me.

3. Distraction easily makes it fade out.

4. I can deliberately distract myself from it.

5. I can't distract it away. But I can work (focus, code, problem solve), but not as well as I'd like.

6. I can't focus on work. Pain stays in my attention. I can have easy, gentle conversation, watch a show, play a simple phone game, doodle.

7. I can't do even something easy, like doodling. Just breathe.

8. There are external signs, like squirming or jiggling my leg, but I can stop them. 

9. Can't be still for long. Sweating, groaning.

10. Yelling, shaking, thrashing, can't "hold still" on request.

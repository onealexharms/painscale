# Rate your pain on a scale of 1 to 10

1. If I think about it, I can find a twinge somewhere.

2. Yeah, there's an ache or whatever, but it's not bothering me.

3. Distraction easily makes it fade out.

4. I have to work to distract myself from it.

5. Distracting myself doesn't make it gone entirely.  Can work (focus, code, problem solve), but greatly reduced capacity.

6. Can't focus on work. Pain has my attention. Can still do easy conversation, nothing intellectually challenging.

7. Can't keep doing even something easy, like a phone game. Just breathe.

8. Body is reacting: shaking, twitching. 

9. Can't be still. Sweating.

10. Yelling, shaking, thrashing, no control.
